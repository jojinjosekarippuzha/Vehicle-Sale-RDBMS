ðŸš— Vehicle Purchase Form Database Project
ðŸŽ‰ Welcome!
Hey there! Welcome to my Vehicle Purchase Form Database Project. This is a fun and practical college assignment where I created a relational database to handle all the nitty-gritty details of vehicle sales. Dive in to see how we turned a simple form into a full-fledged database system!

ðŸŒŸ What's Inside?
The Concept
Imagine a bustling vehicle dealership. To keep track of every sale, trade-in, and customer, you need a solid system. That's exactly what this project does! We designed a database that manages:

NEW VEHICLE: Fresh rides waiting to be driven off the lot.
TRADE-IN VEHICLE: Cars customers are trading in.
BUYER: All the fantastic people buying or trading vehicles.
SALES REPRESENTATIVE: The amazing sales team making it all happen.
PURCHASE AGREEMENT: The official paperwork for each transaction.
Design & Implementation
Conceptual ERD: This is like the blueprint of our database, showing how everything connects.
Physical ERD: The detailed map with all the specifics on how the database is actually built.
Whatâ€™s Included?
Form Image: A snapshot of the unique Vehicle Purchase Form we used. Itâ€™s the starting point for our database adventure!
ERD Documents: A Word file with the blueprints (Conceptual and Physical ERDs) that guided our database creation.
MS Access Database: The heart of the project. This file contains the forms, queries, and reports in action.
Cool Features
Forms: Easy-to-use interfaces for entering and managing vehicle data.
Queries:
Calculated Query: See how much money is still owed by customers.
Parameterized Query: Find buyers linked to a specific sales rep by entering their ID.
Select Queries:
View which vehicles buyers have purchased.
See a list of buyers and both their purchased and trade-in vehicles.
Reports: Visual summaries of all the queries to make sense of the data.

Check Out the Form: Take a look at the image to see the form we started with.
Dive into ERD Docs: Open the Word file for a closer look at our database design.
Play with Queries: Run the queries in Access to see how they pull up and process data.
View Reports: Explore the reports to get a snapshot of the data insights.
ðŸŽˆ Why Itâ€™s Cool
This project is a real-world example of how databases can streamline complex processes like vehicle sales. Whether youâ€™re into database design, vehicle management, or just curious about how it all works, thereâ€™s something here for you.
